## What is that logo?
If you haven't guessed already, it's the beloved Punnett Square! Nothing screams genetics like everyone's first entry-level genetic diagram!


## The Logo Graveyard
While this is completely unrelated to anything important about population genetics or Julia, I (Pavel) want you all to understand the logo-development process that led us to our logo so you can _feel_ my struggle. The process is as follows:

1. Jason and I spitball ideas

2. I procrastinate real work and open up Inkscape to draft some ideas

3. I compose 1-3 versions of an idea and send it to Jason

4. 
   ```julia
   if Jason != veto
   	for i in 1:5
		Jason critiques and suggests changes
   		I makes the changes
   	end
   end	
   ```
   
5. Jason and I finalize the idea!

6. Weeks pass and I'm not quite satisfied and we start at 1 again



I'm happy to say that we love the Punnett Square and it's for keeps, but have a look at the scrapped ideas as a little walk down memory lane:
