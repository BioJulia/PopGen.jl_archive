## nancycats.gen
These are the data provided in the [R package](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/) `adegenet` originally developed by Thibaut Jombart. These data are from Nancy, France, comprising 9 microsatellite loci across 237 individuals in 17 locations. The are available in genepop format.

## gulfsharks.gen
These data are used in [A genomic assessment of movement and gene flow around the South Florida vicariance zone in the migratory coastal blacknose shark, Carcharhinus acronotus](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-019-3533-1). The data include 212 samples from 7 locations (3 in the Atlantic Ocean, 3 in the Gulf of Mexico, and 1 in the Florida Keys) and 2213 putatively neutral SNP loci obtained using double-digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD) techniques and a *de novo* RAD contig assembly. Latitude and longitude data are provided with these data in `gulfsharks.geo.coordinates`, and the genotypes are available in genepop format.
